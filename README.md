# Performing Linear Regression and Multivariate Linear Regression

We have a file ext1data1.txt that contains our dataset of our linear regression problem. The first column is the population of the city and the second column is the profit of having a store in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.

the file ex1data2.txt contains our dataset for our multivariate linear regression problem. The first column is the size of the house (in square feet), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column (the output $y$) is the price of the house.

You can find the detailed code in the notebook

Cheers!!
